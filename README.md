# YouTube Mockup
A quick mockup of a YouTube watch page to test my skills with embedding media and formatting with HTML and CSS.  The up-to-date version of this mockup can be found [here](https://codydegen.github.io/youtube_mockup/)

# Remaining Issues
I won't come back to this for a bit but if I did, here are the things I'd like to improve:
* Use .svg icons instead of the messy .png icons I used
* Update the formatting to change when viewport size changes
* Add in remaining missing functionality- dropdown menus and the like
